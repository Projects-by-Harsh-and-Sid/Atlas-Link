The reckless way the planet\u2019s orbit was populated by machines and debris led to distortions in the gravity field. All this culminated in a disastrous slingshot effect for the many satellites orbiting the blue dot, altering their trajectories to loosen the direct gravity pull of the planet and scatter into deep space. Some of these satellites contained valuable data that was lost forever.  In 2621, the Council of Peace put a bounty on these ancient artifacts to integrate them into Star Atlas, leading to a hunt for them across the galaxy. One of the most sought-after satellites in history records bears the name of Neil Armstrong, the first human to set foot on the Moon.  Initially launched into medium Earth orbit as a cornerstone of the global positioning system (GPS), the satellite had untold additional capabilities that made it more and more valuable as it drifted off into the void.",

Her strict upbringing under faction-accredited boarding schools caused her to divert from her elected career in interplanetary hospitality and instead sought a fate in the ship races. Within a year, Anna was crowned Prime Champion of the Tri-Faction Circuit and held that status for 3 years. She used that experience to start her own racing & development team called the Sola Protocol. Under her leadership, the team discovered new breakthroughs that shaved minutes off of long established galactic records on the most popular courses. Anna quickly realized her calling as a leader and returned to Captain's training at MUD Academy. Her aptitude for the training was unprecedented and MUD Academy\u2019s Captains curriculum required an update to account for her anomalous abilities.  Exclusive Crew Member that you can assign to a Captain role on your ship containing three or more crew stations.",

You can see it by watching the frown on her forehead. \u201cSo, are you really leaving then?\u201d She asked you, and the tone of her voice betrayed sadness and worry.\n\u201cI need to, my little peli. If I don\u2019t collect those bounties, how are we getting that house on the heights of the Viadorus mountains in Akenat?\n\u201cBut why we must meet in there then? I heard awful things about that place.\u201d She asked, concerned.\n\u201cUnfortunately, the client insisted that we meet there.\u201d Then, after a pause of a few seconds, you take a cube from your clothes and extended it to her.\n\u201cAs long you have this invitation, no one is going to bother you. As soon as I finish my job, I will send you a message, and we will meet there, ok?\u201d\nShe nodded in silence. You knew she wanted to ask you hundreds of questions, but she withheld.\n\u201cWill you tell me the truth the next time we meet?\u201d She asked you while looking directly into your eyes.\n\u201cI will.\u201d You promised, even though this was a promise you knew you shouldn\u2019t fulfill.",

This capital-sized freighter symbolizes prosperity, showing how far the trading amidst the Council of Peace civilizations has progressed, especially after the creation of the Starpath. By being one of the most cost-efficient ways of hauling massive amounts of cargo, the Sledbarge has built its reputation as a reliable freighter for all kinds of cargo. From ores to high-complexity components, it accepts and transports everything to any point in the galaxy.

        "description": "Ustur Faction claims first place in the first full public test of Surge mode achieving over 1000 concurrent players. All participants are awarded a Rare Crew Card in honor of Ustur Champions.  'Everything unfolded as you predicted, Elder. The rival factions were no match for us. I will report back after the award ceremony.' said Gagli.doer, his voice tinged with mixed emotions as he ended the transmission. As he observed the Ustur forces' impeccable coordination in the Surge exercise, orchestrated by the Council of Peace, Gagli.doer's mind wandered back to the adrenaline-fueled days of the Convergence War\u2014the real battles that first tested his mettle. Those memories transported him to his youth on planet Damarah in the Vostalgia Sector, where he and his sister Ustentati would scale Mantrah Trees in endless peaceful days. The pride of his early conscription days resurfaced, sharply contrasted by his first harrowing drop into the trenches of Veldora, a planet now obscured in the High-Risk Zone. The haunting screams from that day still echoed in his meditations whenever his mind started blending with the collective wisdom of the Ustur Elder Conscience.  The youthful exuberance of his students in their first combat struck him distinctly. The bods and iddt reveled in their triumph, safe from real danger. Their only risk was the playful jibes from peers of other factions; it was indeed something entirely different from what he had experienced, and his impatience with his students\u2019 behavior was overwhelmed by the relief of living through a period of peace.  'In formation, cadets! We head to the Surge exercise's closing ceremony,' Gagli.doer commanded with the distinguished authority of a Captain of the Ustur Fleet, his gaze sweeping over the ranks. 'Maintain discipline. Remember, the cadets from other factions are your allies in the greater mission of peace in Galia. You might rely on them someday.'  With that, he watched the disciplined march of the Ustur soldiers, a proud yet somber reflection of their preparation for the conflicts to come. 'I should surely visit the Mantrah\u2019s again.' Gagli whispered to himself, repeating a declaration that he made many times before but never fulfilled.",

All participants are awarded an Uncommon Crew Card in honor of ONI.\nUla was relieved to finally throw away all that combat gear that made his tentacles get so tingly. He couldn\u2019t care less about combat exercises or politics. In fact, if he had to share his opinion, something that he was strangely not prone to do, like other Miereses, he would say that Vaor Scarka was a danger to the galaxy, and it had nothing to do with the regional divergences between Ekos and Scarkas.\n\u201dNever trust anyone from the Scarka, my boy! Neuno poisons his own waters to try to kill them!\u201d His mother used to say, supposedly joking, but perhaps there was some truth in the advice. Nevertheless, Ula endured the whole thing and probably would endure whatever else they asked him to do because he needed the ATLAS. \nUnlike other members of his species, Ula had a deep passion for science and research. He even went as far as learning, by himself, how to read in the common language at a very young age, something that caused his region lore keeper to ey him for a month. Now, as he was finally old enough to leave family, lore keepers, and Neuno behind, he was able to go explore Galia and learn the scientific truth about things by himself.\nHe figured he would start in Glowhaven, joining the anchorage, the Iris academy expedition, which investigated the weird artifact found in the sector that supposedly was a part of the key to freeing the Mierese God, Onato. Not that Ula believed in Onato\u2019s existence, or any of these weird tales about cosmic currents and other strange phenomenons that his superstitious brethren believed so passionately, his idea was to disproof this supposed artifact as simply the junk it probably was, some scraps left by an ancient civilization, and perhaps help the other Mierese understand that there were more important things than chasing gossips and weird dreams induced by spoiled food.\nLike science, for instance.\nFor that, he needed the ATLAS, and if he had to play tag and shoot a few MUD and Usturs for that, well, that\u2019s it.",

All participants are awarded a Common Crew Card in honor of MUD.\nSigmund Nok was the sixth son of a miner's family in the trying wastes of Kangasso Outskirts in the Exodus sector. From a young age, he worked in the planet's insalubrious mines to help his family make ends meet. Nevertheless, Sigmund's childish body proved more than ill-suited for the insalubrious gases and dryness of the depths of that barren land, and one day, while prospecting an iron vein, he collapsed with an unknown disease that nearly took his life.\nHe was saved by sheer chance. A crew of adventurers was doing a recognition mission close to the mine's location, and one of them, a kind High Punaab, was a capable doctor. His knowledge saved Sigmund\u2019s life and instilled in him the admiration for medicine and the desire to cure people.\nA few years later, he joined the MUD army to finance his studies, and due to his dedication and hard work, he was quickly accepted as a student in the support group of the Volant Station. Now, as he is nearing the end of his period as a soldier in the MUD forces, Sigmund looks forward to a future where he can focus on developing his calling to help heal other people.",
